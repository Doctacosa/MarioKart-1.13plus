MarioKart
=========

This is a 1.13+ fork of the official repo for the MarioKart plugin by storm345 and stormdev

WILL ONLY WORK WITH UCARS 1.13+ (v1.5 and following)
(My fork for that: [uCars 1.13+](https://github.com/Jakllp/ucars))

There is a 1.16(+) branch that adds custom minecart textures.
For jar
See releases with 1.16+

Other requirements:
- COAL_BLOCK needs to be roadblock when using roadblocks (for powerups)
